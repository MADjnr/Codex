Good explanations are those which provide understanding of particular phenomena.

Science has three primary aims: 
- Prediction
- Control 
- Explanation of phenomena.
However, the goal of science is the construction of theories that can provide explanatory accounts of features of the world.

Explanation's purpose which is the goal of explantion is what makes it the most important aim of science. And the reason that explanation is primary is that it allows for prediction and control.

The understanding gained through the explanation can help us to control the explanadum. Therefore, it is right to say that the primary aim of science is to produce understanding via explanations. `Using the understanding gained via explanations to yield accurate prediction and to allow for increased control of phenomena are important secondary aims of science.` [[2.3Theoretical modelling of conceptual frame work]] [[2.1From Research Question to Hypothesis]]
Recognizing the centrality of understanding to science is an important insight as is the fact that the vehicle by which we typically gain understanding is explanation. Moreover, by coming to better understand the nature of explanation and the sort of information that explanatiions convey we will be better equipped to explore the nature of understanding.

### Difference between explanation and explaining:
An explanation is a collection of proposition. in other words, explanations are sets of proposition that provide answers to why questions- the sorth of questions we seek to answer when we are explaining things.

An easy way to distinguish between explanations and explaining is in terms of cognitive outcomes versus cognitive processes. `Explaining is a cognitive process which, when successful, yield a particular cognitive outcome. This cognitive outcome,explanation is one that promotes understanding.

The exact features a collection of propositions has to have in order to be an explanation, is the question that theories of explanation seek to answer 

The statistical relevance for to occur is that system should be found in  states.

### Hampel's Theories of Explanation:
Hampel's proposes two theories of explanation, the D-N Model and the Inductive-Statistical(I-S)
The two models share some features: First, both adhere to the majority view that explanations are sets of propositions(the explanans) provide support for a proposition that describes the phenonmenon to be explained (the explanadum). Third, both require that the explanas include at least one proposition which describes a general law of nature as well as propositions that accurately describe the empirical conditions relevant to the phenomena's occurance. #physicsinformed 

Successful I-S Model explanations are different. In this model, the explanation involves statistical laws and the explanandum is not shown to deductively follow from the explanans in this sort of explanation. Instead, a successful I-S explanation shows that the explanans confer a higher probability on the explanandum.

### Alternatives to the Hampels's theories and working Model
An early alternative to Hampel's theories is wesley salmon's Statistical Relevance (SR) account for explanation. According to the SR account, explanation requires describing the factor that are stastistically relevant to the occurance of the explananadum. `A particular factor is statistically relevant to E's occurring when the probability of E's occurance is greater when the factor is present than when it is not.

Another alternative to Hampel's theories is the Unificationist account of explanation. The idea here is that explanation consists in subsuming the explanadum phenomenon under a system of laws which best unifies the relevant phenomena.

### A plausible working model of the nature of explanation of our purposes:
- Explanations track dependence relations: It is to say that explanations are sets of propostions that provide information about dependence relations which hold between the explanans and the explanandum. #ModulationWithPrather/Fundamentals 
What makes the above working model a useful working model is that there are a number of different kinds of dependence relatiions.
Dependent relations:
- Causal dependence: Sort of relation that hold when one thing causes another.
- Consitution relation is a dependence relation too
- Mereological dependence: When the properties of a whole or the fact that a whole instantiates a certain property, may depend on the properties and relations had by its parts.

The fact that there are many kinds of dependence relations that our working model is ecumenical. This is because it encompases all sorts of relation that the prominient theories of explanation claims are of central importance. #physicsinformed 



### Summary;
We can understand an explanation to be a set of propositions where the explanans provides information about dependence relations which hold between phenomena described in the explanans and the phenomenon to be explained (the explanandum)
