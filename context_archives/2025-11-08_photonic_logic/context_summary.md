# Context Summary – 2025-11-08 Photonic Logic Task

- **08-11-2025.md:** Daily note linking to the TASK FILES section that authorizes use of the attached electromagnetic notes for the novel photonic logic exercise.
- **??Explanation and Understanding.md:** Emphasizes that useful explanations expose dependence relations and position understanding as the primary aim of science, guiding the way I justify each design decision.
- **Note6_Polarization Reflection and Transmission.md:** Captures lecture insights on linear/circular/elliptical polarization and impedance in lossy media; informs the polarization-diversity stage of the proposed photonic platform.
- **Note7_Vector Potential.md:** Details how vector potentials simplify solving inhomogeneous sources and highlights Lorenz-gauge Green-function solutions, shaping the radiation-modeling workflow.
- **Note2_Circuit-Field Relations and Boundary Conditions.md:** Connects KCL/KVL approximations to Maxwell’s equations and stresses using integral boundary conditions across discontinuities, which I mapped to the electro-optic interface design.
- **vector potential.md:** Provides a physics summary that ties the vector potential to energy/momentum densities in light-matter interactions, grounding the system’s light-driven control logic.
