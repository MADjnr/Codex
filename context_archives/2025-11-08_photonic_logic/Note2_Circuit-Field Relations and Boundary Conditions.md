Maxwell could reduce his set of equations from 20 to 4 because as at the time there is no vector calculus. 

Heri hertz calculated the speed of light by utilizing loop antenna separated between two rooms and the receiving antenna had a spark and it was how he calculated the speed of light. 

The only thing that existed at the instant of the big bang is electromagnetic waves. At that instant, energy existed in the form of heat and pressure and radiation and all of that is electromagnetism. It was too hot and the temperature then was 10 to the power of 32 kelvin. The boiling temperature of water is 10 to the power of 2. Matter could not exist in such extreme environment. Electromagentism were the temperature. For example when you go into a resturant and there is chicken under a low light, that light is the temperature for the chicken. Or you are out in a beach and the sun is making you hot, the sun radiation carries energy and at certain region of the spectrum, that energy it caries is heat and also the sun gives off pressure, something called the solar wind. Therefore at the time of the bigbang, energy was present in the form of heat, pressure and radiation and they were all regarded as electromagnetic fields. 

Until the electromagnetics combined together that it created matter. Matter did not exist. It only existed by the virtue of the fact that electromagnetic energy at high energy when combined together, gives rise to matter and that matter gives to energy. At some point the matter became stable and began to solidify but there were still pretty hot. This whole event gave rise to the cosmic EMP. #ProofIsaamaElectromagneticIsFundamental 


KCL and KVL are all approximation of maxwell's equations [[31-08-2025#Concept Lumped vs. Distributed (and why it matters here)]]

Derivative does not like things that there are discontinous in space. When you go across point of discontinuity, the derivative becomes infinite... unstable. It does not mean it does not have rapid change. But they dont like discontinuity in space. 

Example of discontinuities are:
- Presence of a Source like a Current or Charge
- Going across boundaries say from air to a wall, that is a discontinuity is space and also materials properties. 

So when we do boundary conditions, we dont use derivatives, we use integrals. Integrals handles discontinuities very well. 

Prather showed that integrals handle discontinuities by explaining the delta function in page 5.

Faraday intuitively defined the flux density D

E in circuit equivalent is voltage because the unit is  volts per meter
H in the context of circuit is the current and the unit is Ampere per meter.
Flux becomes more involved. Flux brought the understanding of flux. He showed that flux is the same thing as your source. In the faraday experiment he utilized sphere to conduct his experiment. Faraday explained Flux density as if he add all the lines of forces, he will get the total amount of charge in the sphere. This is how gauss law came to be. 

Magnetic flux is different because they always come back where they have started. Magnets always come back where they started. instead of looking at a closed sphere, take a magnet and wire a loop and the lines of forces go up and come back. If the magnetic source is move there is an induced current sitting in free space. This happens because the magnetic flux emanating from the magnetic source is penetrating the space, when moved, which is where the time derivative of B with respect to t comes from, a voltage or current is generated.

## Note: Ji (impressed current density)
- Meaning: Ji is a prescribed (impressed) electric current density set by the source/model, independent of the local fields; units A/m^2.
- Maxwellâ€“AmpÃ¨re: âˆ‡Ã—H = Jc + Ji + âˆ‚D/âˆ‚t, where Jc = ÏƒE is conduction current induced by the fields; Ji is an external source.
- Use cases: port/terminal feed currents (antenna delta-gap, waveguide ports), equivalent volume/surface sources in FDTD/FEM, carrier injection in active regions (e.g., lasers).
- Not Ji: do not use Ji for conduction current driven by an applied voltage in a closed circuit; that is Jc = ÏƒE. Ji is not an â€œinducedâ€ current.
- Units/scope: specify Ji as a spatial/temporal function; surface/line sources come from integrating Ji over area/length.
- Magnetic-current note: Mi (impressed magnetic current) is a mathematical dual for symmetry/equivalent-source formulations; there is no physical magnetic charge/current.## Derivation: Parallel-Plate Capacitance (Lec2 p.9)

Assumptions: two large parallel plates of area \(A\), separation \(d\), filled with a linear, homogeneous dielectric of permittivity \(\varepsilon\); fringing neglected.

  $$\oint_S \mathbf{D}\cdot d\mathbf{S} = Q_{\text{encl}} \;\Rightarrow\; \mathbf{D} = \sigma\,\hat{\mathbf{n}}$$

2) Constitutive relation to get E
- For a linear dielectric:
  $$\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon\,\mathbf{E} \;\Rightarrow\; \mathbf{E} = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}\,\hat{\mathbf{n}}$$
- Between plates, \(\mathbf E\) is uniform; outside it is approximately zero (ignoring fringing).

3) Voltage between plates
- Potential difference is the line integral across the gap:
  $$V = \int_0^{d} \mathbf{E}\cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} = \left(\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}\right)\,d$$

4) Capacitance definition
- Using \(C = Q/V\) with \(Q = \sigma A\) and \(V\) above:
  $$C = \frac{Q}{V} = \frac{\sigma A}{(\sigma/\varepsilon)\,d} = \boxed{\,\frac{\varepsilon A}{d}\,}$$

Notes:
- Units check: \([\varepsilon A/d] = (\text{F/m})\cdot\text{m}^2/\text{m} = \text{F}\).
Capacitors come in different forms. Coaxial cable has several inductor. When we do transmission line, we look at the coaxial cable as a capacitor that is distributed. So it has capacitance per unit length. So we use that to derive its properties as we migrate from lumped to distributed elements in transmission line. 

It is important to see capacitor as a epsilon S over d. 

Center tap transformers are phenomenal because what comes out goes in and it is balanced.

Fields like to be in high index medium. 
Farad is charge per volt, it is the ability to store charge whcih became phrase as capacity hence gave rise to a capacitor. 


## Slide 11
The thing with differentials is that we substract things and divide by the difference and when difference becomes really small or the difference is goes equal to the numerator, it becomes unstable, So when using boundary conditions we use integral forms because we done want things to be unstable at that boundary.  We go back and forth between derivatives and integrals using stokes and divergence theorem. 

## Slide 12
It is important to go through this because you have understand what the mathematics is telling you. 
Breaking down Stokes Theorem:
| ![[Pasted image 20250831200012.png|250]] | ![[Pasted image 20250831200024.png|250]] |
|---|---|
*Caption: Stokes' theorem (display form):*
$$
\\displaystyle \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} \\mathbf{A}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = \\iint_{\\mathcal{S}} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A})\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{S}
$$


The circle in the integral means closed loop stop where you start.
 So it does not have to be circular loop. So if the closed loop is applied for a line dl, line integral, it makes I take a one dimensional journey in a three dimensional space. It is riding a bike. When riding a bike, you are doing a dl, up a hill, on the road, wherever. Sometimes, you end of where you started.

The next is the surface integral
 the other side of stokes is a surface integral. The surface is the cross sectional surface outlined by the line. If it is a square, it is the area of the square, if it is a circle, it is the area of the circle and not a volume enclosed. It is a cross sectional area.  Stokes theorem states that if I integrate a vector A, it could be E or H, and go all the way around, it is equivalent to taking the curl of the vector and integrating across the cross sectional area. 


## Slide 13:
A way to think about the divergence theorem: the United State celebrates independence day on July 4th. On July 4th, fire works are sent up and explode. At the point of ignition, everything diverges. If water is flowing into a sink, that is a negative divergence.  The circle in the divergence, pertains to a surface and not a cross sectional surface as seen in the stokes theorem because that is defined by a line, think of the line as the rim in the tire, the surface is the spokes within the rim, they become continous. so the close loop (the circle) is a closed surface. So now encapsulate whatever volume inside of a closed surface. Like take a circuit or an antenna and put it inside a beachball. Cos the beach ball defines the enclosed surface. This is important because it is where faraday did his experiment. So the sphere where Faraday proved that flux was equivalent to charge has to be in an enclosed sphere. There is where the closed surface comes from. So if you have a beach ball, it encloses, the volume of the sphere. As you can see in the equation, the volume is defined by the surface that encloses it. 

Like in stokes theorem, the cross sectional surface area is defined by the line. When applying it we have to know. The ds in stokes theorem is not the same ds in divergence theorem. Because in stokes, the ds is cross sectional and in divergence, it is a surface that encloses a volume. 

The last equation in page 14 is Kirchoff's current law


## Slide 16: Constitutive Parameters and Relations
If you are elected a senator, you have what we call constituents. Which means when he goes down to DC to vote in order to support a bill, he is representing his constituents. So he represents them collectively with one vote. Same is applied to materials in electrical engineering. If all the parameters are put inside one parameter, it is called a constituent parameter. From the electrical side, the constituent parameter is called permittivity. From the magnetic side, it is called permeability and for the current side it is called conductivity. In non linear optics, you look at the permittivity in a more complex way to a point it is not constant any more. When the permittivity of a material varies with the direction is gives rise to a tensor and it is called anisotropic. 


## Slide 17 Characterization of Materials:
Magnetic field at the atomic level
When you define the orientation of the field, it is called polarization
A field is a vector quantity and vector quantity exists in space, be it cartesian, spherical, cylindrical, it has to be oriented in that space but it has to be oriented within that space. The orientation is called polarization because it gives the way it is pointed within that space. 

## 18 Harmonic
A pitch is a different frequency. Every frequency is one harmonic. In time harmonic form, we are doing a convenient assumption, that the time domain assumptions of my field,  can be expressed as a sinusoid. What is so convenient about it being a sinusoid? it is because you can build different functions from it. Both periodic and aperiodic. When you do periodic, it becomes a fourier series, when you do aperiodic, it becomes a fourier transform  #Einshaman/FourierTransforms . By assuming it is sinusoidal, it is not as limited as you think, because if I have a time based function different from a sinusoid, it gives the ability to reconstruct any signal. So makes a decent assumption possible where all the time derivatives, become multiplicative and I dont have to think about doing a time derivative anymore, it becomes a Jw. 

When I apply time harmonics to maxwell's all d/dt becomes time Jw. 

Remember the tradeoff between conduction current and displacement current is that displacement current can go through an insulator because as long as I have electrons flowing, there is no longer fields. The fields manifest within the current.  


## Slide 19:
The ratio to tell what material properties are. 

## Slide 20:
Linear time invariant systems
When I make an assumption where I can do a fourier transform #Einshaman/FourierTransforms  , I am assuming that the system is linear. We rely on nonlinearity every time we do anything electronic. Whenever we transmit signal we rely on the product in the red ink to multiply two signals together and this is how we do frequency up or downconversion. It is the basis of how all radios work and all cell phones, everyhing. Thats how everything that has communication to it.


## Slide 16
E in the perimittivity is an external applied field. It is a field put in say form of antenna, coax, transistor, maybe its a laser. Sometimes the permittivity can be a function of the electric field. Say you hit the material with a electric field, the material's parameters can change based on the presence of the field. If its a constant then it is called a linear material. If its based on the response to the field, it could be E^2...it is called nonlinear responses.

## Slide 20:
Homogenous and nonhomogeonus can be explained that you have morphins and with blue berries, that is nonhomogenous, but if you have morphins with blue berries and rapsberries that is inhomogenous 
Isotropic means that its the same properties no matter the direction we look in the material. It is the same Morphins. What if you have the morphins with blue berries lined up in row. In one direction they are close to each other. And in another direction they are separated by a bigger distance. So if you look at it in different direction there is one permittivity. In another direction there is another permittivity. And in anoter direction there is another permittivity. Then the material is called anisotropic. 
Dispersive Vs nondispersive means that all the material properties are functions of frequency. There is no such thing as a material without a function of frequency but as we look at the material over a local region of spectrum, do they vary on small region, we can assume in some cases, that it is a non dispersive material if you work over a finite frequency range and the material does not change. but as you go from zero to infinity there is a huge change in every single material.

Every circuit theory is an approximation of maxwell's equations. 
We are all immersed in radiations. From infrared to devices like Wifi, bluetooth.

Proximity current in the card that opens the door has a magnet inside it. The magnet generate a current, the current has a tiny circuit, that gives off a signature that is unique to the user. The card does not have a battery it just has a magnetic field that generate a voltage that gives rise to the current. Magnetic flux gives rise to the inductance. [check time stamp 20mins] L stands for the quantity of magnetic flux generated by unit current whereas capacitance is how much electric flux generated by unit volt. C and L are parameters based on fields. Inductor and Capacitor devices that work specifically because of the presence of a field.  


## Slide 26:
Mathematics is a language. And its about adding and subtracting. When you add a lot it becomes an integral. 


## Slide 28
I want to have you develop your intuition with this stuff. Dont just see it as a mathematics because there is a huge side of physics to it and it is important to understand it. What makes you stand out in your career is not the ability to solve the mathematics. The math is a puzzle. It is the ability it apply it to a problem, to see the connection between the mathematics and the physics and how that helps solve a problem and use the inside intuition to come up with an idea that is unique, that is where you make your mark.

## Slide 29:
Stray capacitance come from the parasitic or proximity between two circuits or two wires. 


## Slide 30:
Capacitance is some electric flux divided by charge. Henry is the amount of magnetic flux generated by permit amps. Henry is the unit of inductance just like a farad is the unit of capacitance

## Slide 31:
There is an intimate coupling between faraday's law and KVL and the continuity equation.

## Slide 33:
E and H are like V and I. But the units of E is volts per meter and the unit of H is amps per meter. So we have V time I over meter squared. We know in circuit theory that the power in a circuit is VI. This is because we have uniquely identified voltages and current. But when we look at fields, it is no longer the case. There are no isolated fields. Fields by definition are expansive, you cannot have a point field. The way we transport power through fields is by radiating electric and magnetic fields that have a power density. The unfortunate thing is that when fields are transferred, they are expansive. So if we transmit from a point say to the back of the room, it goes like a ginormous waveform but we only have an antenna this big. And this antenna misses everything else. Lets say that there is a small area of that antenna, say 1 meter square. Then it is multiplied by electric and magnetic field that is transmitted from the location per unit area, thats the power that recieve an antenna and this related to power transmission in an antenna. in something called fris equation. This is the ability to close a link. How much power do we need to transmit so that we can get the signal across. Noise is Omnipresent. its called KTB. KTB is essentially some form of thermal noise. Anything with nonzero T, K is the boltzmann's constant and B is the bandwidth of the radaition frequency I am looking at has a noise power. If not done right then the reciever will recieve KTB. We cannot design an antenna that does not accept thermal noise. The whole field of communication and electrical engineering is about SNR engineering.

## Slide 41 [[06-09-2025]] Lec2: version 2
If you do not solve problems in Electromagentics, you do not learn or know electromagnetics. Challenge yourselve. You have dedicate yourself. It is mathematically intense and physically uninutive. I want you to see through math. The math can be intimidating. 
Fields are by definition extending. For example, temperature in different states in the United states are different. Temperature is everywhere, it is not just here. Same with the field. it is everywhere. There are discontinuities in a field but it is only in the presence of a source. If there is there no presence of a source, then the field just continous. 

The only time you see discontuity in a field is when it hits a boundary. When you are in an elevator and you suddenly stop hearing the other person in the call, its because the elevator shields the signal. Boundary conditions are important, this analogy is talked about because of the tangential component of E and H.

4:00 - 5:53 class he talked about being able to take the curved ball when it comes at you. 
In reality there is no impressed magnetic current and  source we do it to maintain mathematical symmetry. Impressed current it putting the current inside something, sourcing... 

We apply stokes theorem to faraday's law in order to get the surface. Farady here is the line integral and the area enclosed by it is the suface, the cross sectional surface. It is defined by the perimeter of the line integral. 

We invoke this for magnetic symmetry.

We do the same for Ampere's law

But we have the ability to put an immpressed current. An impressed current is nothing but putting current into something. Its like current source. Its like the way we put current source all the time in a laser. That is how we create lasing. Instead of electrons into a material that jump from the other shell to the  inner shell, the difference is a single photon. If we put that to a cavity, I can create a positive feedback and that is your laser. So we can do this, we can have a current source Ji in this slide.

we can also have a conduction current, Jc. Here I have a voltage source instead of a current source. That voltage source will induce a current by virtue of Ohms law. So if I have a battery and a Resistor and an Ammeter, then we gonna have a current from there that is not an impressed current because it is a voltage source and not a current source. But we can have conduction current because of the presence of a voltage source in a closed circuit. 
**Self reflections: Here he is talking about the two current densities in Ampere's law**  The we have the third part of the equation, the equation that maxwell himseld invented. This is literally because it did not exist in faraday's law. Maxwell observed it because he looked at the d/dt in the faraday's law, what if we call a d/dt of something in the Ampere's law. Even though then, he does not know what it was. After manipulating symmetry, he realized that this is called displacement current.

These are coupled integral equations. #ModulationWithPrather/AskPrather How are the equations coupled. He said he did his PhD solving those a long time ago. When we go to the differential part, then it is still there, then we solve the wave equation to decouple them E and H. 

## Slide 42 Lec2 Version_2
Explanation of information derived when you read through this header::
- Understanding of the mathematical steps to understand how the tangential component of a E electric field is zero for a PEC for the tangential component of H for a PEC is not. 

### This process completes for the explanation of how to derive the boundary condition for Tangential E

We apply the integral equations to the boundary conditions. 
The dl in the slide shows the closed line integral. This is the cross sectional surface of the boundary ![[SmartSelect_20250906_154214_Video Player.jpg|400]]
As we are looking at the line integral above, I take it and reduce the dl2 and dl4 tending to zero. This is because when we are talking about boundary conditions, we are actually interested at the fields at the boudary. We much dl2 and dl4 at the boundary then, dl1 and dl3 are right at the top and bottom. dl2 and dl4 are zero because we mash them down at the boundaries. But dl2 and dl4 are not equal to zero. ds goes to zero because there is no surface.

if you observe, dl1 and d3 goes opposite ways. Remeber they are vectors. ![[Pasted image 20250906162952.jpg|400]]
![[Pasted image 20250906164555.jpg|400]]


E_t here is a tangential component because we assume if we have a tangential vector, right on the surface, it is tangential to the plane.it is not normal to the plane because it is dl. it is tangential to the plane. Any field coming in at any angle, when you do the inner product of the tangential vector it is only going to take out the tangential component.  The normal component does not survive the inner product. Say it comes in at an arbitrary angle say E_x, E_y, E_z, then there is this tangential vector divided by dl and do the inner product, the only term that survives that is the electric field component also laying in that plane. The normal component does not factor in. E_t1 because it is in medium 1, E_t2, because it is in medium 2. 

The only way Et_1 is equals to E_t2 is when dl is equals to zero.

### We follow the same method to derive for the H
Just follow the integral for H in [[Note2_Circuit-Field Relations and Boundary Conditions#Slide 41 06-09-2025 Lec2 version 2|Slide 41]]
![[Lec2_Version2.pdf#page=42&rect=622,120,789,289|Lec2_Version2, p.42|400]]
ds goes term goes to zero but the J term does not go zero because we can have J right at that surface. Recall that fields are distributed.  We cannot have a point field.  But we can have a point source like a proton or electron but the field that comes off from that point source goes off for ever. the field is 1/r. r does approach infinity and the field does decrease but it does not go to zero. So a field is distributed but a source is isolated current, voltage. To the extent that we can have source defined anywhere I like. ![[Lec2_Version2.pdf#page=42&rect=2,188,147,388|Lec2_Version2, p.42|400]]
We can use mathematics to represent spatial distributions in a dimension we so choose. What is the interpretation of the delta function as used in the context here #ModulationWithPrather/AskPrather 

![[Lec2_Version2.pdf#page=42&rect=14,518,349,608|Lec2_Version2, p.42]] We can also do it for a line charge. It does not have anything to do with Z. so we can go from a volume charge to line charge because it is only defined along the Z axis. What this means is that we can have point sources that are continous. We can do the same for current J.![[Lec2_Version2.pdf#page=42&rect=363,506,791,613|Lec2_Version2, p.42]] You can define sources using discontinuities. So we can define J to have a surface integral, integrate it with ds. and it equals J_s.  

If we filter it out we have H_t1 minus H_t2. It is not the same for the electric field case. The electric field case went to zero because, there is no magnetic current source. We cannot have a sheet magnetic current. We can have a sheet or surface electric current. 

The difference between the tangential component in the electrical case is that, when we go through a media that does not have conductivity it continues across the boundary. It could be discontinous, if I have the presence of a surface current.  You dont always have the presence of a surface current, you have to be told if there is a presence of a surface current. 

Most of the times, the surface current is equals to a zero. For example, if you are going through a glass, through a plastic, through a wood, through a brick. All those dont have Js. This means that the tangential component of magnetic field is also equals to zero because the J in that case will also be equals to zero.  if we go through a dielectric, it is continous, they go as if the medium is not even there. And this is only the tangential component. it is not true for a normal component. But the difference is if I have a perfect electric conductor. When we hit the field on a perfect conductor, With the polarity plus or minus, the electrons can quickly rearrange themselve. The glass before is now a conductor. And the electrons can rearrange themselve, instantaneously if we assume the material is truly perfect in reality. In reality nothing is perfect. It takes some time to do that, which means the field can extend a little bit into the medium. Hence it is called skin depth #ModulationWithPrather/PrepQuals  . But for the sake of discussion it is a perfect conductor, we put the field there, it will distribute itself to form the exact opposite field on the surface. So now they cancel each other out. That is why the tangential component of the electric field is gonna be zero. 

You light a match and put it inside a cup of water, its going to go out. A match inside a cup of water does not burn. Likewise, you cannot have an electric field inside a conductor without it being extinguished by its ability of electrons to conduct, hence the term, its a conductor. They are free to move, so they gonna move in a way to extinguish the field.  On a PEC the tangential component of electric field is equal to zero. In the case of a magnetic field, the internal component also has to be equals to zero, but now, there is a still a surface current on the other side. That does not go to zero. So now the tangential component of the magnetic field on a PEC is not equal to zero. It is equal to a current. It induces a current and that current has to exist to generate the other field component that cancels it out. Therefore Ht is not equals to zero as it is for E_t for a PEC. it is equal to a current. 


## Slide 48:
Before we proceed to this slide, recall that we already showed in [[Note2_Circuit-Field Relations and Boundary Conditions#Slide 42 Lec2 Version_2| Slide 42]], that the using Faraday's law and Stokes theorem, that the tangential component of electric field across a perfect dielectric boundary is continuous. 

But here we see that the normal component is discontinous by the ratio of the permittivities of the materials. 

Start with the assumption that between the material there is no charge there, so we assume a perfect dielectric. So it is equal to zero
![[Pasted image 20250906202649.jpg]]
from the slide, you can see that the only reaaon where top is different from is that n_top is equal to -n_bottom. 
Then follow the arrow of the Dn_1 and Dn_2 equals to zero is created. The normal component of the electric field is discontinous across a boundary. Not the tangential component. We just showed that using Faraday's law, and stokes theorem that the tangential component of electric field across a perfect dielectric boundary is continous. The normal component is discontinous by the ratio of the permittivities of the two materials. 

There is a caveat, if we say that we can have a surface. If we collapse the cylinder to a surface. If we collapse the top and bottom to that surface. Now the Volume still goes to zero and the surface area still goes to zero but now right at that interface. the delta function of z, because it lies in the X-Y plane, there is charge and the charge is distributed as coulomb's per meter square, it is surface current. That why when the right hand side goes from zero to rho as can be seen in the slide written close to zero. That means that Dn1 - Dn2 is not continous across a surface, if there is a presence of a surface charge, it is discontinous by a source. It is discontionus at the presence of a source.

the reason why it is a rhos of s and not a q, not a rhos o v or l, is because the right hand side is an integral .ds 
![[Pasted image 20250906204553.jpg]]

initially it was a rhos_v dv. It came from applying the divergence theorem to gauss law. dv could be dx, dy, dz. 

we can write rhos_s equals to rhos_v

see the arrow moves from tripple integral rhos_v dv to rho_s dx dy


## Slide 49:
We go through the process again for the magnetic field. Following exactly slide 48. but there is no rhos_v at the right hand side. so it does goes to zero. but the zero does not have an equivalend rhos_s. Because we do not have magnetic surface charge, because there are no magnetic point charges. There are no magnetic charges. This is because, anytime there is a magnet, it goes from north pole to south pole. When you take a magnet and you cut into half and you thinking that you will just divide them into a north and a south pole, guess what, one of those north poles, does have a north and a south pole. This is because every magnetic source always starts and ends. In electric case they just go out they never come back. 

So in this case we have B2 - B1, which means that the magnetic field is always always continous across a material interface. The electric field is also continous across a dielectric interface, where there is no presence of a presence of a surface charge. If i put a surface charge there, then the electric field will be discontinous by the presence of the source. 


## Slide 49 deeper:
if we have a PEC, perfect electrical conductor. then the normal field onto the surface, what extinguishes the tangential component when I come into the surface is that now I have a plus and a minus. The electrons close to the minus and gonna go away while the electrons close the to positive will gather and will generate equal but an opposite field. goes to zero

Have a normal field coming in now, there is a plus and a minus, electrons will see the minus and go away. What was not charge neutral to begin with, now with the absence of electrons, leaves behind a net positive charge and then it is distributed over the surface. So a field coming in does not go zero because it is only a single polarity. That single polarity induces a surface charge on that PEC. So the interior field component has to go to zero but the exterior field component is equal now to the induced surface charge. This happens only on a conductor. You cannot induce a surface charge on a dielectric because the charges are not free to move. What induces that surface charge is the fact when you come in with polarity, you made electrons move away from a repulsive force which is coulomb's law.

## Slide 50:
This is the same notion of PEC. PEC assumes that the conductivity is infinite. It assumes that the electrons can move at inifinite speed. It assumes that if we put a field, the electron instantaneous rearrange themselve, by virtue of their ability to move which is conductivity. which extinguishes the field. In reality, the electrons have mass, they have a finite ability to move, and that is why it is called mobility. 

If it is a DC field then everything is in static condition. If it is a RF field with a constant wt, then the field is constantly changin polarity. such that electrons are constantly going in and constantly going out. The field move so fast because the frequency is so high, electrons cant keep up! What this means is that sometimes, the field will penetrate into the material and now we field which like a voltage inside a conductor that has a finite conductivity we have Ohms law V= IR. We generate a current. The current is electrons trying to move, re extinguish that field. This means we have a finite conductivity with a current and this is now called Ohmic Losses, I^2 R. Just like you will have in a wire. There are times when we have fields going through cables, going through a waveguide, those fields are hitting the boundaries. 

If those conductors, for example coaxial cables has a center conductor and a sheet around it. The coaxial means that there is a co-axis, that is finite conductivity. The fields going down there generate current and those current have ohmic losses. And those losses are worse with higher frequencies because the electrons cannot keep up. so the fields go faster and faster which means they penetrate more. 

What we end up learning about is that if there is a signal from a signal generator, say a 500MHz source and put it into a Coaxial RG 58 and we plug it into an Oscilloscope to see the trace and we see this is great. Then we put in one volt and a 500MHz, we see .99999V, the capable is perfect. Then if we change it from 500MHz to 20GHz, then still put in 1volts, then suddenly we have .1volts. Why there is just a capble in the middle. Its just a wire. The reason is because the conductor, ie the properties of the wire got worse and worse and worse, at higher frequencies. So when you put 1volt, it is dissipated across the cable before it gets to the oscilloscope, there is nothing left depending on the frequency, the length and the conductivity. 

This is where he discussed about the experience at the Navy of a bent waveguide. What happened was that there is so much loss in the waveguide that it bent, melted. The bent pipe had a change in impedance. 

As Engineers we have to think about things inthe context. In the real world/ 

## Slide 51:
As already known in PEC, one of the term goes to zero. The reason it goes to zero is because we cannot have a field inside a PEC, we cannot have field penerate into a non PEC - This is exactly how we get power dissipation.

## Slide Deriving the Surface Impedance:
A plane wave has two components. 


## Slide 65:
Explaining how telephone message is received from one person to another:

When you take your  phone and write to someone; I will see you in 10 mins, a minute or two, the person responds, Okay. Where does that come from? magic happens right?
Waves are propagating through free space. These waves fly in every direction but one of those direction, it will run into an antenna. That antenna is connected to a base station. That antenna has a field in it, and it is electromagnetic field. Every field that radiate has both electric and magnetic property. So if I have an electromagnetic field on your piece of metal, the electromagnetic field is going to hit the metal in the antenna, tangential field component of that magnetic field generates a current. When there is a current on a piece of metal, you can connect it an amplifier, from that amplifier, it can be made into a digital signal with an ADC. I can take that put that into my processing system and decrypt the modulation on the digital signal that says hey, Denise says he wants to see you in 10mins. What happens is that the antenna generates a current, it has a current now, that means it has to have a magnetic field, because it is time varying, also has to have electric field. It radiates. It always goes wherever it wants to go, but part of it hits your phone.  

What we doing is that we are transferring power. Because when I have a current and I have a metal of finite conductivity, I have I^2 R. It generates a power.  That power is where my signal is contained in. With this ability to transfer power. We have to look at the ability of the field to propagates in free space, as being carriers of power. Solar cells, receive that power from the sun and use it to generate electricity. If I can have solar cells all over my roof then I can harness all that power and turn it into a useful power, as opposed to me that have roof without powers. 

If I talk of power, if I integrate that over some time frame, I can have a capacitor, all a capacitor does is integrate. This is because it accumulates charge. If i hit it with something, it is going to build up, its gonna accumulate charge. To the extent that you will have the capacity to store charge, hence capacitance. Its like powering water into a bucket, the bigger the bucket, the more water it can contain. So power and energy are in waves. This codifies to all the electromagetics we have talked about. 
![[Screenshot 2025-09-07 143555.png]]

How does this convey power and why did I not do H cross V X E? This is where mathematics becomes a story not as a equation. This is because mathematics tells the story.  Why did we not do H X ( DEL X E)
The magnetic field must be perpendicular to E and the Curl. So if we do inner product of that, it means we are also doing an inner product of the right hand side. 

## Slide 67
![[Screenshot 2025-09-07 144800.png]]

I if we call E x H a vector say P, now there is divergence of a Vector, So apply the divergence of a vector. divergence theorem, integrate.
If we have a propagating wave, the E points in one direction and the H points in the perpendicular direction. E x H is the direction of power. 




## Slide 70:
Pe is the power existing the surface based on E x H. This is the power existing the closed surface E x H. 
Ps is the power from the sources which is impressed. 
Pd is the power dissipated
- What we mean by dissipated power is that there is a conduction current and there is a field. And the conduction current will give rise to ohmic heating like a current flowing through a resistor. The sigma is 1/resistivity. 
PH is the power stored in the magnetic field. Md is not equal to zero but Mi is always equals to zero since there is no way to impress a magnetic current. 
But We do have displaced magnetic field which gives rise to sources and that is the whole aspect of faraday's law. dB/dt is a magnetic displacement current and it gives rise to a source. 

From the drawing in the page, imagine that there is a coil and there is a magnetic field going through the cross sectional area that varies with time, it will generate a current in that loop without anything connected to it, Its just a wire suspended in air and changing magnetic field. 
- This is the basis of [[Note2_Circuit-Field Relations and Boundary Conditions#Slide 25|card readers]] . When you take the card reader and put it against the wall, the door opens, what is there is that there is a magnetic field in that card that generate a current and reradiates the signal based on the Unique RFID and then it hits the circuit inside the little box on the wall, the door opens.

### How Surface Impedance come into PICS
Follow slide on Surface Integral

In Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs), the **surface impedance concept** shows up naturally when light is confined and guided in structures like waveguides, couplers, or modulators. 

Inside a waveguide on a TFLN PIC, for example, the **tangential electric field** $E_t$ and **tangential magnetic field** $H_t$ at the waveguideÃ¢â‚¬â€œcladding boundary determine how much power stays confined versus leaks out. 

The **effective index** $n_{\text{eff}}$ of a mode essentially encodes this balance, since it arises from enforcing the boundary condition that $E_t$ and $H_t$ remain related across the LNÃ¢â‚¬â€œSiO$_2$ or LNÃ¢â‚¬â€œair interfaces. 

Similarly, the **propagation constant**  

$$
\beta = k_0 n_{\text{eff}}
$$  

and the **mode overlap factor** (important in electro-optic modulation) depend on how tangential fields satisfy the impedance condition at the electrodeÃ¢â‚¬â€œdielectric and dielectricÃ¢â‚¬â€œair boundaries. 

If the surface impedance is mismatched (e.g., poor index contrast or metal absorption), more field energy couples into lossy regions, raising the **propagation loss** $\alpha$. 

In grating couplers, the impedance match between the silicon or TFLN waveguide and free space ($377~\Omega$) governs the coupling efficiency, while in AWGs the **focal spot quality** depends on consistent impedance matching across arrayed arms. 

In short, PIC parameters like $n_{\text{eff}}, \beta, \alpha,$ and coupling efficiency are physical expressions of how well the tangential $E$ and $H$ fields satisfy surface impedance conditions at every material boundary in the circuit.



This derives how surface impedance appears in the mode solver formulation of a waveguide:
Start with time-harmonic MaxwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s equations in each homogeneous region of the cross-section and assume a guided mode proportional to $e^{j\beta z}$. At any material boundary $\Gamma$ that you choose to model by an impedance boundary (e.g., metals/electrodes, textured claddings, or deliberately Ã¢â‚¬Å“engineeredÃ¢â‚¬Â surfaces), impose the Leontovich condition from Balanis:

$$
\mathbf{E}_t = Z_s \, (\hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \mathbf{H}),
\quad \text{with} \quad Z_s = \eta Z_0,
$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is the outward normal, $Z_0$ is $377~\Omega$, and $\eta$ is the normalized surface impedance (for passive surfaces $\Re\{\eta\} \geq 0$). This boundary condition is an (accurate-when-appropriate) third-kind approximation that collapses complex near-surface physics into a local proportionality between the **tangential** fields, because those are the field components directly constrained at interfaces and tied to power flow along the boundary.

To embed this in an eigenmode formulation, eliminate $\mathbf{H}$ using  

$$
\mathbf{H} = \frac{1}{j \omega \mu} \nabla \times \mathbf{E}.
$$

Then the impedance boundary becomes  

$$
\boxed{\;\mathbf{E}_t = \frac{Z_s}{j \omega \mu} \, \hat{\mathbf{n}} \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{E})\;}
$$

For a planar boundary and a TE-like mode where the scalar unknown is $E_y$, this reduces to a Robin (impedance) condition on the **normal derivative** of the transverse field:

$$
\boxed{\;\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial n} = j \, \frac{\omega \mu}{Z_s} \, E_y\;}
$$

and for a TM-like scalar $H_y$:

$$
\boxed{\;\frac{\partial H_y}{\partial n} = j \, \frac{\omega \varepsilon}{Z_s} \, H_y\;}
$$

These boundary relations close the transverse Helmholtz problem:

$$
(\nabla_t^2 + k_0^2 n^2 - \beta^2)\, \psi = 0, \quad \psi \in \{E_y, H_y\}.
$$

In a PIC solver, the eigenvalue $\beta = k_0 n_{\text{eff}}$ emerges from simultaneously satisfying the PDE **and** the impedance boundary on every segment where youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve replaced a real structure by $Z_s$.

### Why this matters for PIC parameters you already use:

- **Effective index $n_{\text{eff}}$ and propagation constant $\beta$:** the complex $Z_s$ tilts the boundary phase between $E_t$ and $H_t$, shifting $\beta$ (phase) and, if $\Im\{Z_s\} \neq 0$ or $\Re\{Z_s\} > 0$, introducing a complex $\beta = \beta' - j \alpha$ (loss per unit length $\alpha$). Thus electrode metal modeled by $Z_s$ directly feeds your simulated $\alpha$ and $Q$.

- **Mode confinement and overlap factors ($\Gamma, \eta_{\text{ov}}$):** the Robin condition above controls how steeply fields Ã¢â‚¬Å“turnÃ¢â‚¬Â at the boundary; stronger impedance mismatch ($|Z_s|$ far from $Z_0$) tends to confine fields differently, changing $\Gamma$ in the core and the overlap with EO regions (e.g., LN near electrodes) that sets $V_\pi L$.

- **Coupling interfaces (gratings, facet taps):** treating the exit/interface as an impedance surface lets you compute reflection/transmission consistently via the same $E_t$Ã¢â‚¬â€œ$H_t$ proportionality used to derive reflection from impedance planes.

Conceptually, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing in a PIC what Balanis motivates in EM: extend the free-space relation  

$$
\mathbf{E} = -Z_0 \, \hat{\mathbf{a}}_r \times \mathbf{H}
$$  

to a **surface** with an effective $Z_s$ and enforce it only on the **tangential** fields that govern boundary power flow. The mode solver turns that into concrete $n_{\text{eff}}, \beta, \alpha,$ and coupling numbers you already optimize.

# Surface Impedance in PICs

In Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs), the **surface impedance concept** shows up naturally when light is confined and guided in structures like waveguides, couplers, or modulators. 

Inside a waveguide on a TFLN PIC, for example, the **tangential electric field** $E_t$ and **tangential magnetic field** $H_t$ at the waveguideÃ¢â‚¬â€œcladding boundary determine how much power stays confined versus leaks out. 

The **effective index** $n_{\text{eff}}$ of a mode essentially encodes this balance, since it arises from enforcing the boundary condition that $E_t$ and $H_t$ remain related across the LNÃ¢â‚¬â€œSiO$_2$ or LNÃ¢â‚¬â€œair interfaces. 

Similarly, the **propagation constant**  

$$
\beta = k_0 n_{\text{eff}}
$$  

and the **mode overlap factor** (important in electro-optic modulation) depend on how tangential fields satisfy the impedance condition at the electrodeÃ¢â‚¬â€œdielectric and dielectricÃ¢â‚¬â€œair boundaries. 

If the surface impedance is mismatched (e.g., poor index contrast or metal absorption), more field energy couples into lossy regions, raising the **propagation loss** $\alpha$. 

In grating couplers, the impedance match between the silicon or TFLN waveguide and free space ($377~\Omega$) governs the coupling efficiency, while in AWGs the **focal spot quality** depends on consistent impedance matching across arrayed arms. 

In short, PIC parameters like $n_{\text{eff}}, \beta, \alpha,$ and coupling efficiency are physical expressions of how well the tangential $E$ and $H$ fields satisfy surface impedance conditions at every material boundary in the circuit.

## Cheat Sheet: Surface Impedance & Power
- Impedance BC: For isotropic surfaces, E_t ≈ Z_s H_t (phasor). Re{Z_s} dissipates power; Im{Z_s} stores or returns energy.
- Average power into surface: ⟨S⟩·n = 1/2 Re{E_t × H_t*}·n = 1/2 |H_t|^2 Re{Z_s} = 1/2 |E_t|^2 Re{1/Z_s}.
- Special cases: PEC (Z_s → 0 ⇒ E_t → 0, reflection); resistive sheet (Z_s = R_s ⇒ p_abs = 1/2 |H_t|^2 R_s); good conductor (Z_s ≈ (1 + j)√(ωμ/2σ), δ = √(2/(ωμσ))).
- Currents: J_i impressed source; J_c = σE conduction; J_d = ∂D/∂t displacement; M_i is an equivalent (mathematical) magnetic source.
- Units: Z_s in Ω/sq; S in W/m^2; J in A/m^2.

See also: [[Note1_Power Flow and Time Harmonic Fields]] for Poynting theorem and time-harmonic averaging.

Start with time-harmonic MaxwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s equations in each homogeneous region of the cross-section and assume a guided mode proportional to $e^{j\beta z}$. At any material boundary $\Gamma$ that you choose to model by an impedance boundary (e.g., metals/electrodes, textured claddings, or deliberately Ã¢â‚¬Å“engineeredÃ¢â‚¬Â surfaces), impose the Leontovich condition:

$$
\mathbf{E}_t = Z_s \, (\hat{\mathbf{n}} \times \mathbf{H}),
\quad \text{with} \quad Z_s = \eta Z_0,
$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is the outward normal, $Z_0$ is $377~\Omega$, and $\eta$ is the normalized surface impedance (for passive surfaces $\Re\{\eta\} \geq 0$). This boundary condition is an (accurate-when-appropriate) third-kind approximation that collapses complex near-surface physics into a local proportionality between the **tangential** fields, because those are the field components directly constrained at interfaces and tied to power flow along the boundary.

To embed this in an eigenmode formulation, eliminate $\mathbf{H}$ using  

$$
\mathbf{H} = \frac{1}{j \omega \mu} \nabla \times \mathbf{E}.
$$

Then the impedance boundary becomes  

$$
\boxed{\;\mathbf{E}_t = \frac{Z_s}{j \omega \mu} \, \hat{\mathbf{n}} \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{E})\;}
$$

For a planar boundary and a TE-like mode where the scalar unknown is $E_y$, this reduces to a Robin (impedance) condition on the **normal derivative** of the transverse field:

$$
\boxed{\;\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial n} = j \, \frac{\omega \mu}{Z_s} \, E_y\;}
$$

and for a TM-like scalar $H_y$:

$$
\boxed{\;\frac{\partial H_y}{\partial n} = j \, \frac{\omega \varepsilon}{Z_s} \, H_y\;}
$$

These boundary relations close the transverse Helmholtz problem:

$$
(\nabla_t^2 + k_0^2 n^2 - \beta^2)\, \psi = 0, \quad \psi \in \{E_y, H_y\}.
$$

In a PIC solver, the eigenvalue $\beta = k_0 n_{\text{eff}}$ emerges from simultaneously satisfying the PDE **and** the impedance boundary on every segment where youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve replaced a real structure by $Z_s$.

**Conceptual takeaway**: In a PIC youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re extending the free-space relation  

$$
\mathbf{E} = -Z_0 \, \hat{\mathbf{a}}_r \times \mathbf{H}
$$  

to a **surface** with an effective $Z_s$ and enforcing it only on the **tangential** fields that govern boundary power flow. The mode solver then converts that into concrete values of $n_{\text{eff}}, \beta, \alpha,$ and coupling metrics you already optimize.


### PIC Analog or Digital
A **Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC)** is neither purely analog nor purely digital Ã¢â‚¬â€ it can be **either or both**, depending on its function and design:

### 1. **Analog Nature**

- Light is a wave, and most PIC components (waveguides, couplers, modulators, resonators, AWGs, etc.) manipulate **continuous analog quantities**: amplitude, phase, polarization, and wavelength.
    
- For example:
    
    - A MachÃ¢â‚¬â€œZehnder Modulator (MZM) changes the phase of light continuously.
        
    - An Arrayed Waveguide Grating (AWG) disperses wavelengths continuously across output channels.
        
- These are inherently **analog signal-processing operations**.
    

### 2. **Digital Nature**

- When PICs interface with digital electronics (e.g., CMOS drivers or photodetectors connected to ADCs), they can represent **binary information**.
    
- In **optical communication systems**, a PIC modulator can encode 1s and 0s into light intensity (on/off keying) or phase states (QPSK, QAM, etc.).
    
- Similarly, detectors convert optical signals back to digital bits.
    

### 3. **Hybrid View (Most Common in Practice)**

- In **telecom and datacom**, PICs act as **analog processors for light**, but the overall system (with digital logic and coding schemes) makes them part of a **digital communication pipeline**.
    
- In **quantum PICs**, operations are often analog in physics but used for digital quantum information (qubits).


### Vpi L
- **VÃâ‚¬ (half-wave voltage):** the electrical voltage needed to induce a Ãâ‚¬ phase shift in the optical mode traveling through a modulator.
    
- **L (interaction length):** the length of the electrode region over which the electric field interacts with the optical mode.
    
- The product **VÃâ‚¬Ã‚Â·L** is a **figure of merit (FoM)** for electro-optic modulators.
    
    - Smaller VÃâ‚¬Ã‚Â·L Ã¢â€ â€™ stronger electro-optic interaction (better efficiency).
        
    - Units: VoltÃ‚Â·cm.

## 2. **Why It Matters**

Think of it as a **cost of controlling light**:

- **VÃâ‚¬** tells you _how much voltage you need_ for control.
    
- **L** tells you _how long you must interact_ with the light.
    
- Their product shows **how efficiently the material converts an applied electric field into optical phase shift**.
    

For lithium niobate:

- Strong **Pockels effect** (r33 Ã¢â€°Ë† 30 pm/V) Ã¢â€ â€™ inherently low VÃâ‚¬Ã‚Â·L compared to silicon.
    
- Thin-film LN (TFLN) improves confinement, so the overlap between the RF field and optical field is higher Ã¢â€ â€™ reducing VÃâ‚¬Ã‚Â·L further.
    

---

## 3. **Relation to Analog vs Digital PIC Discussion**

- **Analog side:**  
    VÃâ‚¬Ã‚Â·L defines how continuously and efficiently you can tune the optical phase, which is central to modulators, resonators, and filters.
    
- **Digital side:**  
    In digital communications, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just want to tune phase; you want to encode **1s and 0s reliably**. A low VÃâ‚¬Ã‚Â·L means less voltage per bit Ã¢â€ â€™ **higher energy efficiency and faster digital modulation**.
    

So, **VÃâ‚¬Ã‚Â·L bridges the analog physics of phase control and the digital function of encoding information.**

---

## 4. **Relation to Other Conversations WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Had**

- **AWGs and Rowland geometry:** Those are passive devices. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need VÃâ‚¬Ã‚Â·L, but if you add heaters or EO tuning, the effective "tuning efficiency" depends on this metric.
    
- **Surface impedance, Poynting theorem, inverse design:** All tie back to field overlap and energy transfer. VÃâ‚¬Ã‚Â·L is _literally an overlap integral metric_ Ã¢â‚¬â€ the tighter the RF and optical mode coupling, the smaller the product.
    
- **TFLN vs BTO squeezing:** Both materials are compared partly by their achievable VÃâ‚¬Ã‚Â·L (LN: lower voltage Ãƒâ€” moderate length, BTO: possibly ultra-low voltage but with integration challenges).
    
- **PICs being analog vs digital:** VÃâ‚¬Ã‚Â·L determines how easily the analog control of phase (continuous) can be leveraged for digital encoding of bits (discrete).
    

---

## 5. **Analogy**

Imagine turning a steering wheel to change direction:

- **VÃâ‚¬** = how much force you need to turn the wheel.
    
- **L** = how many turns of the wheel it takes to complete a U-turn.
    
- **VÃâ‚¬Ã‚Â·L** = the combined effort. A small product means the car is **responsive** Ã¢â‚¬â€ little effort, quick turn. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exactly what you want in modulators: responsiveness with low drive power.
    

---

Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Summary:**  
VÃâ‚¬Ã‚Â·L is the key figure of merit that connects the **physics of electro-optic interaction (analog)** with the **performance of modulators in digital photonic systems**. On TFLN, lowering VÃâ‚¬Ã‚Â·L is what makes it attractive for high-speed, low-power PIC applications.
