GitHub is a website where people store code and work together, with a time machine for every change.

Domain vs. Range — five one‑sentence takes:
- Machine view: The domain is every allowed input to the function, while the range is every output the function actually produces from those inputs.
- Graph view: The domain lives on the horizontal x‑axis (permitted x‑values), and the range lives on the vertical y‑axis (resulting y‑values).
- Rules lens: The domain lists what the rule can accept without breaking its rules, and the range lists what values the rule returns when applied legally.
- Data mapping: If a function pairs each student ID to a final grade, the set of all IDs is the domain, and the set of grades that actually occur is the range.
- Set‑theory contrast: For f: A → B, the domain is A, while the range is the subset of B that f actually hits (the codomain may be larger).
